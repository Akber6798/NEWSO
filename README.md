In this project, I have developed a cutting-edge News App using Flutter, a cross-platform framework. The app is designed to deliver the latest news to users from various sources in a seamless and engaging manner. It features an intuitive user interface, ensuring a smooth news consumption experience for everyone.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
1.  API Integration: The app fetches news data from a reliable news API, ensuring that users get up-to-date information on current 
    events.
2.  Google Firebase Authentication: To provide a secure user experience, I have implemented Google Firebase Authentication, allowing 
    users to sign in and access personalized news content.
3.  News Fetching: Users can browse through a wide range of news articles.
4.  Sort by News Functionality: The app allows users to sort news articles based on their preferences, such as sorting by date, 
    popularity, or relevance.
5.  News Share Functionality: Sharing interesting news stories is made effortless with the built-in share functionality. Users can share 
    articles with friends and family via various platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, or Twitter.
6.  News Webviews: When users want to read the complete article, they can simply click on an article, and the app will load the full 
    story in a web view, ensuring a seamless reading experience.
7.  Search Functionality: The app includes a powerful search feature, enabling users to find specific news articles or topics they are 
    interested in.
8.  Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms have been put in place to provide users with a smooth experience even in case of 
    network issues or API errors.
9.  Dark Mode: Recognizing the importance of user preferences, the app supports a Dark Mode option, making it easier on the eyes during 
    nighttime browsing.
10. Simple and beautiful animation
